# Open for Developers

Open Integration Hub is a framework and meant to be used and adjusted for many different use cases. It is open source, so you have the freedom to change whatever you feel is necessary. You will find all of our code on [GitHub](https://github.com/openintegrationhub). There is also quite some technical details around deployment and configuration of each service on GitHub. This section will provide you with some more technical explanation that you may need to develop your own connector, setup a local dev-environment or want to run a system in production.

We welcome all contributions and feedback from the community. Please check the [contribution guideline](https://github.com/openintegrationhub/openintegrationhub/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.
