# Learn the Basics

This section contains explanations of all basic concepts used in the Open Integration Hub. You will learn about [Integration Components]({$ link docs/BasicConcepts/ComponentsBasics.md }), which are your connection to any application or API. How you can use these components to exchange data between multiple systems via a [Flow]({% link docs/BasicConcepts/FlowBasics.md %}) and how [Flows are executed]({% link docs/BasicConcepts/FlowExecution.md %}).

We encourage you to learn the basics first. If you want to get your hands dirty right away, you can also head over to the [Deplyoment Section]({% link docs/Deployment/Intro.md %}).
