# Learn the Basics

This section contains explanations of all basic concepts used in the Open Integration Hub. You will learn about [Integration Components](https://openintegrationhub.github.io/docs/1%20-%20BasicConcepts/ComponentsBasics.html), which are your connection to any application or API. How you can use these components to exchange data between multiple systems via a [Flow](https://openintegrationhub.github.io/docs/1%20-%20BasicConcepts/FlowBasics.html) and how [Flows are executed](https://openintegrationhub.github.io/docs/1%20-%20BasicConcepts/FlowExecution.html).

We encourage you to learn the basics first. If you want to get your hands dirty right away, you can also head over to the [Deplyoment Section](https://openintegrationhub.github.io/docs/3%20-%20Deployment/Intro.html).
