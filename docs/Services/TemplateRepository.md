# **Template Repository** <!-- make sure spelling is consistent with other sources and within this document -->

## Introduction

<!-- 2 sentences: what does it do and how -->

The Template Repository is responsible for storing, retrieving and updating the integration flow templates. Additionally, it can be used to generate integration flows.

## Technologies used

<!-- please name and elaborate on other technologies or standards the service uses -->

[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/): MongoDB is used as the Template Repository's storage solution.

## How it works

<!-- describe core functionalities and underlying concepts in more detail -->

### Templates

A Flow Template is described by a JSON document, describing information required to generate and produce an [integration flow](https://openintegrationhub.github.io//docs/5%20-%20Services/FlowRepository.html). The purpose of templates is to allow the secure re-use and sharing of integration flows. The template includes the entire flow graph, as well as placeholders for information which must be provided to execute a flow. The template can be modified and distributed separate from flow objects.

```json
{
  "status": "draft",
  "name": "Example Template",
  "description": "Basic Template passing data between two components",
  "graph": {
    "nodes": [
      {
        "id": "step_1",
        "componentId": "1234",
        "function": "getData",
        "description": "Obtain data from an origin"
      },
      {
        "id": "step_2",
        "componentId": "5678",
        "function": "postData",
        "description": "Send data to target system"
      }
    ],
    "edges": [
      {
        "source": "step_1",
        "target": "step_2"
      }
    ]
  },
  "owners": [
    {
      "id": "5abf822aa994a100000426ca",
      "type": "user"
    }
  ],
  "createdAt": "2021-01-18T08:34:45.800Z",
  "updatedAt": "2021-01-18T08:34:45.800Z",
  "id": "60054800000c03001f3ead80"
}
```

Note that in practice, nodes will have additional fields, such as what component they use or secrets/arguments to be used by that component.

### Template Repository API

The Template Repository offers a REST API through which flows can be stored, retrieved, updated, started, and stopped. To interact with this API, the user must supply a valid bearer token generated by the [Identity Management](https://openintegrationhub.github.io//docs/5%20-%20Services/IdentityManagement.html).

| ------------------------ | :----: | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| /templates               |  GET   | Returns a list of all templates the user owns                       | See the section "Ownership and Permissions" for further details                       |

| /templates/{id}/generate |  POST  | Creates an integration flow based on the template and provided data | Data provided in the request body will be merged with the template to create the flow |

For further details and examples, please refer to the [API Reference](http://template-repository.openintegrationhub.com/api-docs/)

### Ownership and Permissions

Each template contains an arbitrarily long array of _owners_. A template can only be accessed if the current user (as identified by their bearer token) is among those owners.

Additionally, manipulation of templates is further limited by the permissions of the current user. There are separate permissions for viewing, posting/updating, and generating integration flows. For further information about permissions, please refer to the documentation of the [Identity Management](https://openintegrationhub.github.io//docs/5%20-%20Services/IdentityManagement.html).

### Interaction with other Services

The Template Repository interacts with these Services:

- [Identity Management](https://openintegrationhub.github.io//docs/5%20-%20Services/IdentityManagement.html): The Template Repository relies on a bearer token supplied by the Identity Management to determine which templates the current user may see, and which actions they may take.

- [Flow Repository](https://openintegrationhub.github.io//docs/5%20-%20Services/FlowRepository.html): The Template Repository API can generate flows in the Flow Repository for users which have sufficient permissions. These flows will contain a reference to the template which was used in their generation.

- [Component Repository](https://openintegrationhub.github.io//docs/5%20-%20Services/ComponentRepository.html): Components used in a flow template are specified as references to documents in the Component Repository.

- [Secret Service](https://openintegrationhub.github.io//docs/5%20-%20Services/SecretService.html): If an integration flow uses sensitive data (such as login credentials), this data can be securely and opaquely stored in the Secret Service and then referenced.
