# **Governance Service** <!-- make sure spelling is consistent with other sources and within this document -->

## Introduction

<!-- 2 sentences: what does it do and how -->

The Governance Service serves as the central repository for all data governance-related data and functions inside the OIH. It offers both a database for long-term storage of relevant data as well as an API for data retrieval and validation.

[API Reference](http://governance-service.openintegrationhub.com/api-docs/){: .btn .fs-5 .mb-4 .mb-md-0 }
[Implementation](https://github.com/openintegrationhub/openintegrationhub/tree/master/services/governance-service){: .btn .fs-5 .mb-4 .mb-md-0 }

## Technologies used

<!-- please name and elaborate on other technologies or standards the service uses -->

[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/): MongoDB is used as the Geovernance Service storage solution.

## How it works

<!-- describe core functionalities and underlying concepts in more detail -->

### Data Provenance

The "Data Provenance" function of the Governance Repository is intended to allow users to reconstruct their data's path through the OIH from the very first time it was synchronized up until the current moment. This way, the data owner will be able to track all origins and destinations of their data, and whether it has been modified inside the OIH. This way, the data owner will be made more capable of complying with data governance policies and laws, such as the GDPR.

To this end, the Governance Service is capable of receiving metadata about certain events, such as a data object being transmitted from one application to another, and stores it as a detailed data provenance event. These events can then be retrieved, filtered, and searched using the Service's API.

#### Provenance data model

The used data model is based on [PROV-DM](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-dm/). This allows for easy mapping and export of provenance data to other systems. The model describes tuples of entities, agents, and activities, in addition to optional situational fields, such as describing one agent acting on behalf of another.

Example provenance object:

```json
{
  "entity": {
    "id": "aoveu03dv921dvo",
    "entityType": "oihUid"
  },
  "activity": {
    "activityType": "ObjectReceived",
    "used": "getPersons",
    "startedAtTime": "2020-10-19T09:47:11+00:00",
    "endedAtTime": "2020-10-19T09:47:15+00:00"
  },
  "agent": {
    "id": "w4298jb9q74z4dmjuo",
    "agentType": "Component",
    "name": "Google Connector"
  },
  "actedOnBehalfOf": [
    {
      "first": true,
      "id": "w4298jb9q74z4dmjuo",
      "agentType": "Component",
      "actedOnBehalfOf": "j460ge49qh3rusfuoh"
    },
    {
      "id": "j460ge49qh3rusfuoh",
      "agentType": "User",
      "actedOnBehalfOf": "t454rt565zz57"
    },
    {
      "id": "t454rt565zz57",
      "agentType": "Tenant"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Using the Governance Service

Besides a running instance of the Governance Service it is required to set the flag _governance: true_ in the _nodeSettings_ of each flow step.

Furthermore the ID-Linking functionality of the [Ferryman](https://openintegrationhub.github.io//docs/5%20-%20Services/IdentityManagement.html) should be activated by setting the _nodeSettings_ flag _idLinking:true_. This will also require that the
[Data Hub](https://openintegrationhub.github.io//docs/5%20-%20Services/DataHub.html) Service is running. Otherwise it is not guaranteed that every provenance event hat the required oihId.

### Governance Service API

The Governance Service offers a REST API through which the stored provenance data can be retrieved. To interact with this API, the user must supply a valid bearer token generated by the [Identity Management](https://openintegrationhub.github.io//docs/5%20-%20Services/IdentityManagement.html).

#### List of supported Methods and Routes

---

| endpoint | method | description                        | comments                                                |
| -------- | :----: | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| /event   |  GET   | Searches stored provenance events. | Based on the supplied filter criteria as detailed below |

The following query parameters can be appended to the Url to further refine the result list:

- page[size]
- page[number]
- from
- until
- filter[agent.id]
- filter[agent.agentType]
- filter[actedOnBehalfOf]
- filter[activityId]
- filter[activityType]

More details about the endpoint can be found in the swagger documentation of the service.

### Interaction with other Services

<!-- list and link the services this one interacts with and describe each interaction briefly (1-2 sentences) -->

- [Ferryman](https://openintegrationhub.github.io//docs/5%20-%20Services/Ferryman.html):
  The Governance Service receives provenance events emitted by the ferryman module running on top of each Connector

- [Data Hub](https://openintegrationhub.github.io//docs/5%20-%20Services/DataHub.html): Optionally the ferryman sends the recordId the connector provides for an entry to the Data Hub for ID-linking to one OihId

- [Identity Management](https://openintegrationhub.github.io//docs/5%20-%20Services/IdentityManagement.html): The Governance Service API endpoints relies on a bearer token supplied by the Identity Management to determine which integration flows the current user may see, and which actions they may take.
