## How it works
<!-- describe core functionalities and underlying concepts in more detail -->

It listens for incoming HTTP connections, serializes incoming data and puts it to the queue of the first node of the flow. The message is being consumed and processed by the component.

### Available endpoints

- `HEAD /hook/{flowId}` - returns `200` if a flow is found and ready for receiving messages, otherwise `404`. This endpoint doesn't process any incoming data.
- `GET /hook/{flowId}` - this endpoint processes incoming data. It's possible to pass message arguments as query params and headers.
- `POST /hook/{flowId}` - this endpoint processes incoming data. It allows to pass data in request body, headers or query params.
