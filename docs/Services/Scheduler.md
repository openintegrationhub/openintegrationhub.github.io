## Introduction

<!-- 2 sentences: what does it do and how -->
The service scheduler is responsible for a periodical execution of integration flows.

## Technologies used

- Cron-Deamon

## How it works
<!-- describe core functionalities and underlying concepts in more detail -->

In the Open Integration Hub there is a great number of active integration flows
to be executed periodically. Each integration can be configured with a
[Cron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) expression defining flow's execution
interval. Let's consider the following Cron expression:

````sh
*/3 * * * *
````

The cron expression above executes an integration flow at every 3rd
minute starting from the flow's start time.

With the following Cron expression a flow is executed every Sunday at 6:00 am:

````sh
0 6 * * 7
````

The Scheduler iterates over all active integration flows and evaluates
their Cron expressions. Is a flow due to be executed, Scheduler tells the
Resource Coordinator to deploy the integration flow for execution.
