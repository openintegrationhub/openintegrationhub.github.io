# Snapshots service

## Introduction
This service is responsible for storing flow snapshots.

### What is a snapshot?
Snapshot is a feature of the OIH platform, which provides flows components a possibility to store some `state` between executions.
A typical use case is to store some `timestamp` and use it to query records from a certain system, created after this `timestamp`,
so that you would not need to query full list of records each time.

## Technologies used
- Node.js
- Typescript
- MongoDB
- RabbitMQ

## How it works
It connects to the RabbitMQ queue, which is in turn subscribed for the `snapshot` events, fired by flow components.
The service consume the messages from the queue and writes it to the DB. The snapshots are then accessible via REST API.

### Interaction with other Services
- Interacts with IAM to introspect provided IAM token.
- Consumes `snapshot` events from flow components via RabbitMQ.
- Component Orchestrator queries the service and provides snapshots to each flow component.
