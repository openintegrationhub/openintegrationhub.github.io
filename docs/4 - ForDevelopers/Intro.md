# Open for Developers

Open Integration Hub is a framework and meant to be used and adjusted for many different use cases. It is open source, so you have the freedom to change whatever you feel necessary. You will find all of our code on GitHub. There is also quite some technical details around deployment and configuration of each service on GitHub. This section will provide you with some more technical explanation that you may need to develop your own connector, setup a local dev-environment, want to run a system in production or feel like contributing to the framework.
